# DelayScope

Evaluate various system components to measure their responsiveness in terms of latency. It runs a series of tests on your system and gives you an in-depth look at how each key resource is performing. It generates a final score that summarizes the overall system responsiveness, with detailed reports on each component's performance.

## Key components tested:

- **CPU Responsiveness: Measures how quickly the processor responds to complex operations.**

- **Disk Responsiveness: Measures the disk’s read and write performance.**

- **Memory Responsiveness: Assesses the memory performance by allocating and processing test data.**

- **Network Responsiveness: Evaluates network latency by pinging a target (Google DNS).**
