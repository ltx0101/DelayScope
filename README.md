# DelayScope

Evaluate various system components to measure their responsiveness in terms of latency. It runs a series of tests on your system and gives you an in-depth look at how each key resource is performing. It generates a final score that summarizes the overall system responsiveness, with detailed reports on each component's performance.

## Key components tested:

CPU Responsiveness: Measures how quickly the processor responds to complex operations.

Disk Responsiveness: Measures the diskâ€™s read and write performance.

Memory Responsiveness: Assesses the memory performance by allocating and processing test data.

Network Responsiveness: Evaluates network latency by pinging a target (Google DNS).

UI Responsiveness: Measures how quickly the system can respond to user interface operations.
